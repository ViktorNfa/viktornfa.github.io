# About me

I am a PhD Student at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm associated with the Division of Decision and Control Systems (DCS) and supervised by Prof. [Dimos Dimarogonas](https://people.kth.se/~dimos/). I am also an affiliated student with the Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program ([WASP](https://wasp-sweden.org/)). My primary research interest lies in multi-agent systems, robotics, safety-critical and Human-In-the-Loop (HIL) control and I am currently working with the precision agriculture [EU CANOPIES](https://canopies.inf.uniroma3.it/) project, the [Digital Futures Smart Construction](https://www.digitalfutures.kth.se/research/industrial-innovation-projects/towards-safe-smart-construction-algorithms-digital-twins-and-infrastructures/) project and the underwater HRI project SHARCEX.

I'm always looking for motivated students interested in the fields of task and motion planning, robotic manipulation and HIL control, so if you want to collaborate for your Master Thesis or independent work feel free to drop me an email or check my proposals in the [DCS website](https://www.kth.se/social/group/dsc-msc-thesis-propo/page/available-msc-project-proposals-at-dcs/).

I'm also very interested on innovation, entrepreneurship and open-source development; and I have experience co-founding and leading a startup, so if you are interested on collaboration feel free to send me an email.

Before coming to Stockholm, I obtained my bachelor's degree in aerospace engineering from Universidad Carlos III de Madrid (Spain), and a master's degree from KTH Royal institute of Technology (Sweden). During my MSc, I also worked as a research engineer at the Smart Mobility Lab (SML) KTH for Professor [Dimos Dimarogonas’s](https://people.kth.se/~dimos/) group.
